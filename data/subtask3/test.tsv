Despite the Constitution ’s broad grants of state authority , one of the central goals of the Anti - Federalists , a group opposed to several components of the Constitution , was to preserve state government authority , protect the small states , and keep government power concentrated in the hands of the people .   For this reason , the Tenth Amendment was included in the Bill of Rights to create a class of powers , known as [ER] reserved powers [ER] , [EH] exclusive to state governments [EH] .   The amendment specifically reads , “ The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . ”   In essence , if the Constitution does not decree that an activity should be performed by the national government and does not restrict the state government from engaging in it , then the state is seen as having the power to perform the function .
