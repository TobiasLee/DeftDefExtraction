When Keynes wrote his great work The General Theory of Employment , Interest , and Money during the Great Depression of the 1930s , he pointed out that during the Depression , the capacity of the economy to supply goods and services had not changed much .   U.S. unemployment rates soared higher than 20 % from 1933 to 1935 , but the number of possible workers had not increased or decreased much 4616 .   While we applaud the technology spillovers of NASA ’s space projects , we should also acknowledge that those benefits are not shared equally .

The intuition behind Say ’s law is that each time a good or service is produced and sold , it generates income that is earned for someone : a worker , a manager , an owner , or those who are workers , managers , and owners at firms that supply inputs along the chain of production .

The price elasticity of supply is the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price . Elasticities can be usefully divided into three broad categories : elastic , inelastic , and unitary .   An elastic demand or elastic supply is one in which the elasticity is greater than one , indicating a high responsiveness to changes in price .	Direct-Defines

While in the short run firms are limited to operating on a single average cost curve ( corresponding to the level of fixed costs they have chosen ) , in the long run when all costs are variable , they can choose to operate on any average cost curve .   Thus , the long - run average cost ( LRAC ) curve is actually based on a group of short - run average cost ( SRAC ) curves , each of which represents one specific level of fixed costs .

A rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of that good or service , while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied .   When the price of gasoline rises , for example , it encourages profit - seeking firms to take several actions : expand exploration for oil reserves ; drill for more oil ; invest in more pipelines and oil tankers to bring the oil to plants where it can be refined into gasoline ; build new oil refineries ; purchase additional pipelines and trucks to ship the gasoline to gas stations ; and open more gas stations or keep existing gas stations open longer hours .

[ER] A natural monopoly [ER] [EH] arises when average costs are declining over the range of production that satisfies market demand [EH] .   This typically happens when fixed costs are large relative to variable costs .	Direct-Defines

These types of laws , which specify allowable quantities of pollution and which also may detail which pollution - control technologies must be used , fall under the category of command - and - control regulation .   In effect , [ER] command - and - control regulation [ER] [EH] requires that firms increase their costs by installing anti - pollution equipment ; firms are thus required to take the social costs of pollution into account [EH] .   Command - and - control regulation has been highly successful in protecting and cleaning up the U.S. environment .	Direct-Defines

4107 .   These conceptualizations are referred to as response - based definitions because they describe stress as a response to environmental conditions .   For example , the endocrinologist Hans Selye , a famous stress researcher , once defined [ER] stress [ER] as [EH] the “ response of the body to any demand , whether it is caused by , or results in , pleasant or unpleasant conditions ” [EH] ( Selye , 1976 , p. 74 ) .   Selye ’s definition of stress is response - based in that it conceptualizes stress chiefly in terms of the body ’s physiological reaction to any demand that is placed on it .	Direct-Defines
4110 .   Two kinds of appraisals of a stressor are especially important in this regard : primary and secondary appraisals .   [ER] A primary appraisal [ER] involves [EH] judgment about the degree of potential harm or threat to well - being that a stressor might entail [EH] .   A stressor would likely be appraised as a threat if one anticipates that it could lead to some kind of harm , loss , or other negative consequence ; conversely , a stressor would likely be appraised as a challenge if one believes that it carries the potential for gain or personal growth .

4113 .   A person at this stress level is colloquially at the top of his game , meaning he feels fully energized , focused , and can work with minimal effort and maximum efficiency .   But when [EH] stress exceeds this optimal level , it is no longer a positive force — it becomes excessive and debilitating [EH] , or what Selye termed [ER] distress [ER] ( from the Latin dis = “ bad ” ) .   People who reach this level of stress feel burned out ; they are fatigued , exhausted , and their performance begins to decline .	Direct-Defines

Your heart starts to pound and speeds up , you begin to breathe heavily and perspire , you get butterflies in your stomach , and your muscles become tense , preparing you to take some kind of direct action .   Cannon proposed that this reaction , which he called [ER] the fight - or - flight response [ER] , occurs when [EH] a person experiences very strong emotions — especially those associated with a perceived threat [EH] ( Cannon , 1932 ) .   During the fight - or - flight response , the body is rapidly aroused by activation of both the sympathetic nervous system and the endocrine system ( [ link ] ) .	Direct-Defines

[ER] Alarm reaction [ER] describes [EH] the body ’s immediate reaction upon facing a threatening situation or emergency , and it is roughly analogous to the fight - or - flight response described by Cannon [EH] .   During an alarm reaction , you are alerted to a stressor , and your body alarms you with a cascade of physiological reactions that provide you with the energy to manage the situation .	Direct-Defines
4122 .   What goes on inside our bodies when we experience stress ?   The physiological mechanisms of stress are extremely complex , but they generally involve the work of two systems — the sympathetic nervous system and [ER] the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal [ER] ( [EH] HPA [EH] ) axis .   When a person first perceives something as stressful ( Selye ’s alarm reaction ) , the sympathetic nervous system triggers arousal via the release of adrenaline from the adrenal glands .	AKA

In the 1960s , psychiatrists Thomas Holmes and Richard Rahe wanted to examine the link between life stressors and physical illness , based on the hypothesis that life events requiring significant changes in a person ’s normal life routines are stressful , whether these events are desirable or undesirable .   They developed [ER] the Social Readjustment Rating Scale [ER] ( [EH] SRRS [EH] ) , consisting of 43 life events that require varying degrees of personal readjustment ( Holmes & Rahe , 1967 ) .	AKA

Bank capital is [ER] the difference between a bank ’s assets and its liabilities [ER] .   In other words , it is [EH] a bank ’s net worth [EH] .   A bank must have positive net worth ; otherwise it is insolvent or bankrupt , meaning it would not have enough assets to pay back its liabilities .	Supplements

[EH] Depositors racing to the bank to withdraw their deposits [EH] , as shown in [ link ] is called [ER] a bank run [ER] .   In the movie It ’s a Wonderful Life , the bank manager , played by Jimmy Stewart , faces a mob of worried bank depositors who want to withdraw their money , but manages to allay their fears by allowing some of them to withdraw a portion of their deposits — using the money from his own pocket that was supposed to pay for his honeymoon .

5061 .   [ER] Quantitative easing [ER] differed from traditional monetary policy in several key ways .   First , it [EH] involved the Fed purchasing long term Treasury bonds , rather than short term Treasury bills [EH] .   In 2008 , however , it was impossible to stimulate the economy any further by lowering short term rates because they were already as low as they could get .	Direct-Defines
5076 .   This vision of focusing monetary policy on a low rate of inflation is so attractive that many countries have rewritten their central banking laws since in the 1990s to have their bank practice [ER] inflation targeting [ER] , which means that [EH] the central bank is legally required to focus primarily on keeping inflation low [EH] .   By 2014 , central banks in 28 countries , including Austria , Brazil , Canada , Israel , Korea , Mexico , New Zealand , Spain , Sweden , Thailand , and the United Kingdom faced a legal requirement to target the inflation rate .

5079 .   One long - standing concern about having the central bank focus on inflation and unemployment is that it may be overlooking certain other economic problems that are coming in the future .   For example , from 1994 to 2000 during what was known as the “ dot - com ” boom , the U.S. stock market , which is measured by [ER] the Dow Jones Industrial Index [ER] ( which [EH] includes 30 very large companies from across the U.S. economy [EH] ) , nearly tripled in value .

The national saving and investment identity , first introduced in The International Trade and Capital Flows chapter , provides a framework for showing the relationships between the sources of demand and supply in financial capital markets .   The identity begins with a statement that must always hold true : the quantity of financial capital supplied in the market must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded .   The U.S. economy has two main sources for financial capital : private savings from inside the U.S. economy and public savings .   [ER] Total savings [ER] = [EH] Private savings ( S ) + Public savings ( T – G ) [EH]   Total savings = Private savings ( S ) + Public savings ( T – G )   These include the inflow of foreign financial capital from abroad .

3344 .   The neuron is a small information processor , and dendrites serve as input sites where signals are received from other neurons .   These signals are transmitted electrically across the soma and down a major extension from the soma known as the axon , which ends at multiple terminal buttons .   The terminal buttons contain synaptic vesicles that house [ER] neurotransmitters [ER] , [EH] the chemical messengers of the nervous system [EH] .	Direct-Defines
3347 .   In healthy individuals , the neuronal signal moves rapidly down the axon to the terminal buttons , where synaptic vesicles release neurotransmitters into the synapse ( [ link ] ) .   [ER] The synapse [ER] is [EH] a very small space between two neurons and is an important site where communication between neurons occurs [EH] .   Once neurotransmitters are released into the synapse , they travel across the small space and bind with corresponding receptors on the dendrite of an adjacent neuron .	Direct-Defines

The first type , [ER] diagnostic framing [ER] , [EH] states the problem in a clear , easily understood way [EH] .   When applying diagnostic frames , there are no shades of gray : instead , there is the belief that what “ they ” do is wrong and this is how “ we ” will fix it .	Direct-Defines

To deal with this problem , Weber and Dilthey introduced the concept of [ER] verstehen [ER] , [EH] a German word that means to understand in a deep way [EH] .   In seeking verstehen , outside observers of a social world — an entire culture or a small setting — attempt to understand it from an insider ’s point of view .   In his book The Nature of Social Action ( 1922 ) , Weber described sociology as striving to " interpret the meaning of social action and thereby give a causal explanation of the way in which action proceeds and the effects it produces .

5348 .   Functionalism grew out of the writings of English philosopher and biologist , Hebert Spencer ( 1820 – 1903 ) , who saw similarities between society and the human body ; he argued that just as the various organs of the body work together to keep the body functioning , the various parts of society work together to keep society functioning ( Spencer 1898 ) .   The parts of society that Spencer referred to were [ER] the social institutions [ER] , or [EH] patterns of beliefs and behaviors focused on meeting social needs , such as government , education , family , healthcare , religion , and the economy [EH] .	Direct-Defines
5351 .   Durkheim believed that individuals may make up society , but in order to study society , sociologists have to look beyond individuals to social facts .   [ER] Social facts [ER] are [EH] the laws , morals , values , religious beliefs , customs , fashions , rituals , and all of the cultural rules that govern social life [EH] ( Durkheim 1895 ) .   Each of these social facts serves one or more functions within a society .	Direct-Defines
5354 .   Conflict Theory   [ER] Conflict theory [ER] [EH] looks at society as a competition for limited resources [EH] .   This perspective is a macro - level approach most identified with the writings of German philosopher and sociologist Karl Marx ( 1818 – 1883 ) , who saw society as being made up of individuals in different social classes who must compete for social , material , and political resources such as food and housing , employment , education , and leisure time .

5360 .   People commonly try to understand the happenings in their world by finding or creating an explanation for an occurrence .   Social scientists may develop a hypothesis for the same reason .   [ER] A hypothesis [ER] is [EH] a testable educated guess about predicted outcomes between two or more variables ; it ’s a possible explanation for specific happenings in the social world and allows for testing to determine whether the explanation holds true in many instances , as well as among various groups or in different places [EH] .	Direct-Defines
5363 .   Reliability increases the likelihood that what happens to one person will happen to all people in a group .   Researchers also strive for [ER] validity [ER] , which refers to [EH] how well the study measures what it was designed to measure [EH] .   Returning to the crime rate during a full moon topic , reliability of a study would reflect how well the resulting experience represents the average adult crime rate during a full moon .	Direct-Defines
5366 .   [ER] A hypothesis [ER] is [EH] an assumption about how two or more variables are related ; it makes a conjectural statement about the relationship between those variables [EH] .   In sociology , the hypothesis will often predict how one form of human behavior influences another .	Direct-Defines
5372 .   As a research method , [ER] a survey [ER] [EH] collects data from subjects who respond to a series of questions about behaviors and opinions , often in the form of a questionnaire [EH] .   The survey is one of the most widely used scientific research methods .	Direct-Defines
5375 .   The success of a study depends on how well a population is represented by the sample .   In [ER] a random sample [ER] , [EH] every person in a population has the same chance of being chosen for the study [EH] .   According to the laws of probability , random samples represent the population as a whole .	Direct-Defines
5378 .   The researcher will end up with a wide range of responses , some of which may be surprising .   The benefit of written opinions , though , is the wealth of material that they provide .   [ER] An interview [ER] is [EH] a one - on - one conversation between the researcher and the subject , and it is a way of conducting surveys on a topic [EH] .   Interviews are similar to the short - answer questions on surveys in that the researcher asks subjects a series of questions .	Direct-Defines

However , Rothman ’s entertaining article still offered fascinating descriptions of the inside workings of a “ dot com ” company and exemplified the lengths to which a sociologist will go to uncover material .   Rothman had conducted a form of study called [ER] participant observation [ER] , in which [EH] researchers join people and participate in a group ’s routine activities for the purpose of observing them within that context [EH] .   This method lets researchers experience a specific aspect of social life .	Direct-Defines

The feeling that we belong in an elite or select group is a heady one , while the feeling of not being allowed in , or of being in competition with a group , can be motivating in a different way .

In short , [ER] an in - group [ER] is [EH] the group that an individual feels she belongs to , and she believes it to be an integral part of who she is [EH] .	Direct-Defines

5537 .   Sociologist Edwin Lemert expanded on the concepts of labeling theory and identified two types of deviance that affect identity formation .   [ER] Primary deviance [ER] is [EH] a violation of norms that does not result in any long - term effects on the individual ’s self - image or interactions with others [EH] .   Speeding is a deviant act , but receiving a speeding ticket generally does not make others view you as a bad person , nor does it alter your own self - concept .	Direct-Defines
5540 .   Since criminology was a young field , he drew on other aspects of sociology including social interactions and group learning ( Laub 2006 ) .   His conclusions established [ER] differential association theory [ER] , which [EH] suggested that individuals learn deviant behavior from those close to them who provide models of and opportunities for deviance [EH] .   According to Sutherland , deviance is less a personal choice and more a result of differential socialization processes .	Direct-Defines

Those economists who emphasize the role of supply in the macroeconomy often refer to the work of a famous French economist of the early nineteenth century named Jean - Baptiste Say ( 1767 – 1832 ) .   Say ’s law is : “ Supply creates its own demand . ”   As a matter of historical accuracy , it seems clear that Say never actually wrote down this law and that it oversimplifies his beliefs , but the law lives on as useful shorthand for summarizing a point of view .   The intuition behind [ER] Say ’s law [ER] is that [EH] each time a good or service is produced and sold , it generates income that is earned for someone : a worker , a manager , an owner , or those who are workers , managers , and owners at firms that supply inputs along the chain of production [EH] .

To be sure , even if total supply always creates an equal amount of total demand , the economy could still experience a situation of some firms earning profits while other firms suffer losses .

3686 .   Skinner believed that behavior is motivated by the consequences we receive for the behavior : the reinforcements and punishments .   His idea that learning is the result of consequences is based on the law of effect , which was first proposed by psychologist Edward Thorndike .   According to [ER] the law of effect [ER] , [EH] behaviors that are followed by consequences that are satisfying to the organism are more likely to be repeated , and behaviors that are followed by unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated [EH] ( Thorndike , 1911 ) .

For example , while a conflict theorist studying a political protest might focus on class difference , a symbolic interactionist would be more interested in how individuals in the protesting group interact , as well as the signs and symbols protesters use to communicate their message .   The focus on the importance of symbols in building a society led sociologists like Erving Goffman ( 1922 – 1982 ) to develop a technique called [ER] dramaturgical analysis [ER] .   [EH] Goffman used theater as an analogy for social interaction and recognized that people ’s interactions showed patterns of cultural “ scripts . ” [EH] Because it can be unclear what part a person may play in a given situation , he or she has to improvise his or her role as the situation unfolds ( Goffman 1958 ) .

4109 .   A useful way to conceptualize stress is to view it as a process whereby an individual perceives and responds to events that he appraises as overwhelming or threatening to his well - being ( Lazarus & Folkman , 1984 ) .   A critical element of this definition is that it emphasizes the importance of how we appraise — that is , judge — [EH] demanding or threatening events [EH] ( often referred to as [ER] stressors [ER] ) ; these appraisals , in turn , influence our reactions to such events .   Two kinds of appraisals of a stressor are especially important in this regard : primary and secondary appraisals .	Direct-Defines

Computers can be programmed to do many routine tasks faster and less expensively than people who used to do such tasks 4918 .   To build a useful macroeconomic model , we need [ER] a model that shows what determines total supply or total demand for the economy , and how total demand and total supply interact at the macroeconomic level [ER] .

If firms across the economy face a situation where the price level of what they produce and sell is rising , but their costs of production are not rising , then the lure of higher profits will induce them to expand production . The slope of an AS curve changes from nearly flat at its far left to nearly vertical at its far right .   At the far left of the aggregate supply curve , the level of output in the economy is far below [ER] potential GDP [ER] , which is defined as [EH] the quantity that an economy can produce by fully employing its existing levels of labor , physical capital , and technology , in the context of its existing market and legal institutions [EH] .

4960 .   The Keynesian theory implied that during a recession inflationary pressures are low , but when the level of output is at or even pushing beyond potential GDP , the economy is at greater risk for inflation .   [EH] Phillips analyzed 60 years of British data and did find that tradeoff between unemployment and inflation [EH] , which became known as [ER] a Phillips curve [ER] .

4963 .   [ER] Keynesian macroeconomics [ER] [EH] argues that the solution to a recession is expansionary fiscal policy , such as tax cuts to stimulate consumption and investment , or direct increases in government spending that would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right [EH] .   For example , if aggregate demand was originally at ADr in [ link ] , so that the economy was in recession , the appropriate policy would be for government to shift aggregate demand to the right from ADr to ADf , where the economy would be at potential GDP and full employment .

3351 .   [EH] Between signals , the neuron membrane ’s potential is held in a state of readiness [EH] , called [ER] the resting potential [ER] .   Like a rubber band stretched out and waiting to spring into action , ions line up on either side of the cell membrane , ready to rush across the membrane when the neuron goes active and the membrane opens its gates ( i.e. , a sodium - potassium pump that allows movement of ions across the membrane ) .	Direct-Defines
3354 .   This positive spike constitutes [ER] the action potential [ER] : [EH] the electrical signal that typically moves from the cell body down the axon to the axon terminals [EH] .   The electrical signal moves down the axon like a wave ; at each point , some of the sodium ions that enter the cell diffuse to the next section of the axon , raising the charge past the threshold of excitation and triggering a new influx of sodium ions .	Direct-Defines
3357 .   The neurotransmitters travel across the synapse and bind to receptors on the dendrites of the adjacent neuron , and the process repeats itself in the new neuron ( assuming the signal is sufficiently strong to trigger an action potential ) .   Once the signal is delivered , excess neurotransmitters in the synapse drift away , are broken down into inactive fragments , or are reabsorbed in a process known as reuptake .   [ER] Reuptake [ER] [EH] involves the neurotransmitter being pumped back into the neuron that released it , in order to clear the synapse ( [ link ] ) [EH] .	Direct-Defines

If you hate country music , then having it waft into your house every night would be a negative externality .	Direct-Defines
4573 .   Pollution is a negative externality .   Economists illustrate the social costs of production with a demand and supply diagram .   [ER] The social costs [ER] include [EH] the private costs of production incurred by the company and the external costs of pollution that are passed on to society [EH] .	Direct-Defines
4576 .   However , when the externality of pollution exists , the supply curve no longer represents all social costs .   Because externalities represent a case where markets no longer consider all social costs , but only some of them , economists commonly refer to externalities as an example of market failure .   When there is [ER] market failure [ER] , [EH] the private market fails to achieve efficient output , because either firms do not account for all costs incurred in the production of output and/or consumers do not account for all benefits obtained ( a positive externality ) [EH] .

4594 .   Depending on their different income levels and political preferences , countries are likely to make different choices about [ER] allocative efficiency [ER] — that is , [EH] the choice between economic output and environmental protection along the production possibility frontier [EH] .   However , all countries should prefer to make a choice that shows productive efficiency — that is , the choice is somewhere on the production possibility frontier rather than inside it .

4600 .   However , when a firm invests in new technology , the private benefits , or profits , that the firm receives are only a portion of the overall social benefits .   [ER] The social benefits of an innovation [ER] take into account [EH] the value of all the positive externalities of the new idea or product , whether enjoyed by other companies or society as a whole , as well as the private benefits received by the firm that developed the new technology [EH] .   As you learned in Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities , positive externalities are beneficial spillovers to a third party , or parties . Consider the example of the Big Drug Company , which is planning its R&D budget for the next year .	Direct-Defines

Intellectual property rights include [ER] patents [ER] , which [EH] give the inventor the exclusive legal right to make , use , or sell the invention for a limited time [EH] , and copyright laws , which give the author an exclusive legal right over works of literature , music , film / video , and pictures .   For example , if a pharmaceutical firm has a patent on a new drug , then no other firm can manufacture or sell that drug for twenty - one years , unless the firm with the patent grants permission .

4612 .   Instead , public goods have two defining characteristics : they are nonexcludable and nonrivalrous .   The first characteristic , that a public good is [ER] nonexcludable [ER] , means that [EH] it is costly or impossible to exclude someone from using the good [EH] .   If Larry buys a private good like a piece of pizza , then he can exclude others , like Lorna , from eating that pizza 5223 .   Even when their climate and land are well - suited to products like cotton , rice , sugar , or milk , farmers in low - income countries find it difficult to compete .   Farm subsidies in the high - income countries cause farmers in those countries to increase the amount they produce .   This increase in supply drives down world prices of farm products below the costs of production .	Direct-Defines
5232 .   However , Bhutanese politicians , business leaders , and workers hope that if the local industry had a chance to get established , before it needed to face international competition , then a domestic company or group of companies could develop the skills , management , technology , and economies of scale that it needs to become a successful profit - earning domestic industry .   Thus , [ER] the infant industry argument for protectionism [ER] is to [EH] block imports for a limited time , to give the infant industry time to mature , before it starts competing on equal terms in the global economy [EH] .

5235 .   [ER] Anti - dumping laws [ER] [EH] block imports that are sold below the cost of production by imposing tariffs that increase the price of these imports to reflect their cost of production [EH] .   Since dumping is not allowed under the rules of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , nations that believe they are on the receiving end of dumped goods can file a complaint with the WTO .   Anti - dumping complaints have risen in recent years , from about 100 cases per year in the late 1980s to about 200 new cases each year by the late 2000s .	Direct-Defines

5262 .   Thus , the marginal utility that Lilly would gain from , say , increasing her consumption of books from two to three must be equal to the marginal utility that she would lose if her consumption of doughnuts was cut from 120 to 84 — so that her overall utility remains unchanged between points A and B .   Indeed , the slope along an indifference curve is referred to as [ER] the marginal rate of substitution , [ER] which is [EH] the rate at which a person is willing to trade one good for another so that utility will remain the same [EH] .   Indifference curves like Um are steeper on the left and flatter on the right .	Direct-Defines
5271 .   The price of a stock depends on the expected future profits earned by the firm .   The concept of a [ER] present discounted value [ER] ( [EH] PDV [EH] ) , which is defined as the amount you should be willing to pay in the present for a stream of expected future payments , can be used to calculate appropriate prices for stocks and bonds .   To place a present discounted value on a future payment , think about what amount of money you would need to have in the present to equal a certain amount in the future .	AKA

5274 .   The Keynesian cross diagram contains two lines that serve as conceptual guideposts to orient the discussion .   The first is a vertical line showing the level of potential GDP .   [ER] Potential GDP [ER] means the same thing here that it means in the AD / AS diagrams : it refers to [EH] the quantity of output that the economy can produce with full employment of its labor and physical capital [EH] .

5292 .   Remember , the demand curve traces consumers ’ willingness to pay for different quantities .   [EH] The amount that individuals would have been willing to pay , minus the amount that they actually paid [EH] , is called [ER] consumer surplus [ER] .   Consumer surplus is the area labeled F — that is , the area above the market price and below the demand curve .   Consumer and Producer Surplus The somewhat triangular area labeled by F shows the area of consumer surplus , which shows that the equilibrium price in the market was less than what many of the consumers were willing to pay .
